\###Coursework



\*\*This is a coursework on Metropolis Hastings Algorithm \& a research into plane data from Havard Dataverse\*\*



**Part 1**

* Generation of random samples as a result of the random walk algorithm
* Visualise the result onto a histogram and kernel density graph
* Report sample mean \& standard deviation
* Conducting Convergence Diagnostics(Gelman-Rubin) after forming the Markov Chains

**Part 2**

* Report the best times \& best days of the week for minimised delays each year(Plane data)
* Check whether older planes suffer more delays year to year basis
* Fitting a Logistic Regression for probability of US Diverted Flights \& Visualise the coefficients



All data comes from https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/HG7NV7
